    experience: 'During my internship (March 2024 to May 2024) at Google, I developed a comprehensive file search management system using Spring Boot, Kafka, and Elasticsearch. I implemented a secure and scalable architecture, including JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and database indexing. I ensured data consistency between MySQL and Elasticsearch by leveraging Kafka for asynchronous communication and optimized system performance through multi-threaded file search enhancements. My work also included developing custom search features, such as auto-completion, pinyin search, and query error correction, significantly improving user experience and system reliability.',
